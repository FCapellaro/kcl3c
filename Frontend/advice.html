							Valuation is a key part of the selling process, it is vital to have an accurate value for your property. In order to do this, make use of the various <a href="http://www.zoopla.co.uk/home-values/">housing price estimators</a> on sites we list to such as Zoopla and doing research on <a href="http://www.zoopla.co.uk/house-prices/?search_source=top_nav">recent sales</a> in the area and try to identify trends.

						While listing a property with us, you will be prompted to upload media about your property. This is a vital part of marketing that will help you sell your property. Making sure all photos that are uploaded are of a good quality goes a long way to enticing potential buyers.
	    				</p>
						<p>
						 It is important not to mislead the buyer, but to provide informative descriptions of key features of the property, and good images that showcase the selling points.

	    				<h3>
	    					Viewings
	    				</h3>
	    				<p>
						After listing, you may be approached by potential buyers wanting to arrange viewings, it is important that you try to keep an open schedule for this and make sure your house is clean and well decorated for the viewings. You may want to reconsider certain styling elements of your property, such as bright, bold colored wallpaper.
	    				</p>
						<p>
						 Certain styles may fit but may offput certain buyers. Whites, beiges and creams are often safe colors to use when re-decorating for sale. Often, sales can proceed much quicker and buyers can be enticed easier just by removing clutter and unnecessary furniture from the home, making rooms feel bigger. Mirrors are also a great tool for maximising space and making the most of smaller rooms.

	    				<h3>
	    					Legal
	    				</h3>
	    				<p>
						During the process of selling your property there are a number of legal hurdles you should be aware of. When you list your property youâ€™ll need to provide an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates">Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)</a>.
	    				</p>
						<p>
						 We also have to deal with <a href="http://hoa.org.uk/advice/guides-for-homeowners/i-am-selling/conveyancing-made-simple-for-sellers/">Conveyancing</a>. Conveyancing is the legal process of transferring the ownership of your property from you, to the buyer. this is something you will need to have in mind when accepting bids from potential buyers and it is generally good practice to arrange for the services of a solicitor or conveyancer at the same time as listing the property.
