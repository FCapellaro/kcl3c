Account pages- To Do.

	We need to discuss the whole functionality of this part of the site as we did with the wizard and static pages. User paths, things the user can change, needed information ect ect ect.

	General 

		- We need to tie in the pages with the header and footer when thats ready and go over the styling to make it consistent with the rest of the site.

		- We also need to have a full discussion over what sections we need and what the user can do vis a vis account management, work out navigation to and from the main site from certain areas within the account pages.

	Summary Page

		- Depending on what the user has/hasn't done, different things will need to be displayed dynamically, Currently there are a few placeholders and ideas in there but we need to figure out how that is going to work.

	Listings

		- We need to deliberate over the presentation and functionality of this page, again, implemented a little placeholder to try and get a feel for what it might end up looking like.

	User Details

		- I experimented implementing a tabbed panel in the content section to allow the user to edit and save a variety of details. Those details and how it's going to work functionally are going to need to be discussed also, and i'm gonna continue to try and look into how to get it to work :).

	Contact Preferences

		- Since Tony was all about that Email, we're going to have to let the user decide what kind of contact they allow, like a lot of sites do, regarding email newsletter and notifications, ect. We're gonna have to discuss what kind of notification they might get, if at all and whether this page is nessisary and if so, what we will include. I'll try to gather some info from other sites about what they do and make a note :).

	History

		- This page is something i just slapped in. I was also thinking this could be something for the fuller implementation of the system, Once there is search functionality and that accomodation for people looking to buy this could be a favourites section or something similar. Either way, we should discuss novel ideas or interesting things we could do here given the time.

Lots of love, Jack :)
