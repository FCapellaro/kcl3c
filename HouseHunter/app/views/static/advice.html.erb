				Media
			</h3>
			    <p>
			        While listing a property with us, you will be prompted to upload media about your
                    property. This is a vital part of marketing that will help you sell your property.
                    Making sure all photos that are uploaded are of a good quality goes a long way to
                    enticing potential buyers.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        It is important not to mislead the buyer, but to provide informative descriptions of
                    key features of the property, and good images that showcase the selling points.

				Viewings
			</h3>
			    <p>
			        After listing, you may be approached by potential buyers wanting to arrange viewings,
                    it is important that you try to keep an open schedule for this and make sure your house
                    is clean and well decorated for the viewings. You may want to reconsider certain styling
                    elements of your property, such as bright, bold colored wallpaper.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Certain styles may fit but may offput certain buyers. Whites, beiges and creams are
                    often safe colors to use when re-decorating for sale. Often, sales can proceed much
                    quicker and buyers can be enticed easier just by removing clutter and unnecessary
                    furniture from the home, making rooms feel bigger. Mirrors are also a great tool for
                    maximising space and making the most of smaller rooms.

				Legal
			</h3>
			    <p>
			        During the process of selling your property there are a number of legal hurdles you
                    should be aware of. When you list your property youâ€™ll need to provide an
                    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates">
                        Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)</a>.
                </p>
			    <p>
			        We also have to deal with
                    <a href="http://hoa.org.uk/advice/guides-for-homeowners/i-am-selling/conveyancing-made-simple-for-sellers/">
                        Conveyancing</a>. Conveyancing is the legal
                    process of transferring the ownership of your property from you, to the buyer.
                    This is something you will need to have in mind when accepting bids from potential buyers and it is
                    generally good practice to arrange for the services
                    of a solicitor or conveyancer at the same time as listing the property.
